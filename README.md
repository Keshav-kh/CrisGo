## 🎯 The Problem  

In moments of crisis—natural disasters, civil unrest, or mass evacuations—traditional navigation apps fall short. They don’t show active hazards. Social media often spreads unverified rumors. What people truly need is **reliable, real-time intelligence** to navigate safely. Right now, that’s missing.  

---

## 💡 Our Solution  

CrisGo bridges that gap with AI-powered verification, seamless voice reporting, and AR-guided navigation. With CrisGo, you can:  

- ✅ **View verified hazards** in real time on a credibility-based map  
- ✅ **Report incidents hands-free** through natural voice commands  
- ✅ **Find safe routes** that adapt to evolving danger zones  
- ✅ **Navigate with AR** for clear, on-camera, turn-by-turn guidance

- Python 3.9+  
- API keys (Gemini, optional: ElevenLabs, Tavily, Opik)  

### Installation  

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crisgo.git
cd crisgo

# Install frontend
npm install

# Install backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add API keys inside .env
Run servers:

Frontend: npm run dev

Backend: cd backend && python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

Open app: http://localhost:3000

📖 How It Works
Voice Reports
Speak → ElevenLabs STT → Gemini extracts data → Tavily verifies → Map marker created

Safe Routing
Input destination → Fetch hazards → AI routing agent → Generate safest path

AR Navigation
GPS tracking → Route overlay → Voice + camera guidance → Hazard alerts

🎮 Usage Guide
Report an Incident
Tap Report Incident → Speak naturally:
“Flooding on Main Street near the bridge, about 3 feet high.”
→ AI extracts details → Marker added.

Plan a Safe Route
Enter origin + destination → Select mode → View safe path → Start AR mode.

Use AR Navigation
Allow camera + location access → Follow on-screen arrows → Hear voice prompts → Stay updated on hazards nearby.
